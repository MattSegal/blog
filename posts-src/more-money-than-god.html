    <h2>Book Review - More Money Than God</h2>
<p>


More Money than God takes you through the history of hedge funds starting from the first hedge fund in the 1950s to the GFC (2008)

Some guy quoted by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Money_Than_God) describes it as:

> The definitive history of the hedge fund industry, a compelling narrative full of larger-than-life characters and dramatic tales of their financial triumphs and reversals

well there you go. that's the book.

I admittedly haven't finished it, but my favourite thing about it so far is how the story is unfolds without hindsight - in the sense that you are follow the rise and fall of novel trading strategies in sequence. You get a sense for how non-obvious each new strategy was at the time.
